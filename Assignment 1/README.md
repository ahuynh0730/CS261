# Assignment 1 - C Programming Practice

Q0.c
Write a program (Q0.c) to do the following:

	1. In the main() function, declare an integer, x. Then assign it to a random integer value in the interval [0, 10]. Then print the value and address(using the address of operator) of x.
	2. In fooA(int * iptr) function, print the value of the integer pointed to by iptr and the address pointed to by iptr. Change the value of the integerpointed to by iptr as instructed in the skeleton code. Print the address of iptr itself at the end.
	3. In the main() function, following the call to fooA(..), print the value of x. Answer the following question in a comment right after printing the value of x: Is the value of x different than the value that was printed at first? Why or why not?
	4. In fooB(int * jptr) function, print the value of the integer pointed to by jptr and the address pointed to by jptr. Then change the address pointed to by jptr as instructed in the skeleton code. Print the address of jptr itself at the end.
	5. In the main function, following the call to fooB(..), print the value and address of x. Answer the following question in a comment right after printing thevalue and address of x: 
		Are the value and address of x different than the value and address that were printed before the call to fooB(..)? Why or why not?
